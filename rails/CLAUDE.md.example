# Rails Best Practices - Example Configuration

Copy this file to your project root as `CLAUDE.md` to enable Rails patterns.

**Note:** This assumes you've copied/cloned the `agent-notes` repo into your project root.

---

## Option 1: Include All Rails Patterns (Recommended)

Single line includes all Rails modules:

@agent-notes/rails/index.md

---

## Option 2: Include Specific Modules Only

For more control, include individual modules:

### Core Patterns

@agent-notes/rails/models.md
@agent-notes/rails/controllers.md
@agent-notes/rails/routes.md
@agent-notes/rails/concerns.md
@agent-notes/rails/tests.md

### Code Style

@agent-notes/rails/style.md

### Views & Frontend

@agent-notes/rails/views.md
@agent-notes/rails/helpers.md
@agent-notes/rails/javascript.md

### Background & Communication

@agent-notes/rails/jobs.md
@agent-notes/rails/mailers.md
@agent-notes/rails/broadcasting.md

### Database & Storage

@agent-notes/rails/migrations.md
@agent-notes/rails/active_storage.md

### Infrastructure

@agent-notes/rails/lib.md
@agent-notes/rails/initializers.md
@agent-notes/rails/validations.md

---

## Customization

### Disable Specific Modules

Comment out any you don't need:

```markdown
@agent-notes/rails/models.md
<!-- @agent-notes/rails/controllers.md -->  <!-- Disabled -->
@agent-notes/rails/routes.md
```

### Enable Only Core

For a minimal setup, enable just the essentials:

```markdown
@agent-notes/rails/models.md
@agent-notes/rails/controllers.md
@agent-notes/rails/routes.md
@agent-notes/rails/style.md
```

### Enable by Feature

Enable based on what you're working on:

**Working on models?**
```markdown
@agent-notes/rails/models.md
@agent-notes/rails/concerns.md
@agent-notes/rails/validations.md
@agent-notes/rails/tests.md
```

**Working on views?**
```markdown
@agent-notes/rails/views.md
@agent-notes/rails/helpers.md
@agent-notes/rails/javascript.md
```

**Working on background jobs?**
```markdown
@agent-notes/rails/jobs.md
@agent-notes/rails/mailers.md
@agent-notes/rails/broadcasting.md
```

---

## Additional Configuration

You can add project-specific instructions here:

```markdown
## Project-Specific Patterns

@docs/architecture.md
@docs/api_design.md
@docs/deployment.md
```

---

## Notes

- All modules are independent and can be enabled/disabled
- Auto-loads in every new dialog
- Patterns are generic Rails best practices
- Examples are production-ready
- All patterns include testing examples
