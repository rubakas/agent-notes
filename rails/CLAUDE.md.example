@rails/tests.md

### Code Style

Coding conventions and style guidelines:

@rails/style.md

### Views & Frontend

View layer patterns, helpers, and JavaScript:

@rails/views.md
@rails/helpers.md
@rails/javascript.md

### Background & Communication

Background processing, email, and real-time updates:

@rails/jobs.md
@rails/mailers.md
@rails/broadcasting.md

### Database & Storage

Database migrations, file uploads, and data management:

@rails/migrations.md

## Customization

### Disable Specific Modules

Comment out any you don't need:

```markdown
@rails/models.md
<!-- @rails/controllers.md -->  <!-- Disabled -->
@rails/routes.md
```

### Enable Only Core

For a minimal setup, enable just the essentials:

```markdown
@rails/models.md
@rails/controllers.md
@rails/routes.md
@rails/style.md
```

### Enable by Feature

Enable based on what you're working on:

**Working on models?**
```markdown
@rails/models.md
@rails/concerns.md
@rails/validations.md
@rails/tests.md
```

**Working on views?**
```markdown
@rails/views.md
@rails/helpers.md
@rails/javascript.md
```

**Working on background jobs?**
```markdown
@rails/jobs.md
@rails/mailers.md
@rails/broadcasting.md
```

## Additional Configuration

You can add project-specific instructions here:

## Project-Specific Patterns

@docs/architecture.md
@docs/api_design.md
@docs/deployment.md
```

## Notes

- All modules are independent and can be enabled/disabled
- Auto-loads in every new dialog
- Patterns are generic Rails best practices
- Examples are production-ready
- All patterns include testing examples
