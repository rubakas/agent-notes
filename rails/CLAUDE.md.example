# Rails Best Practices - Example Configuration

Copy this file to your project as `CLAUDE.md` to enable Rails patterns.

---

## Option 1: Include All Rails Patterns (Recommended)

Single line includes all Rails modules:

@rails/index.md

---

## Option 2: Include Specific Modules Only

For more control, include individual modules:

### Core Patterns

@rails/models.md
@rails/controllers.md
@rails/routes.md
@rails/concerns.md
@rails/tests.md

### Code Style

@rails/style.md

### Views & Frontend

@rails/views.md
@rails/helpers.md
@rails/javascript.md

### Background & Communication

@rails/jobs.md
@rails/mailers.md
@rails/broadcasting.md

### Database & Storage

@rails/migrations.md
@rails/active_storage.md

### Infrastructure

@rails/lib.md
@rails/initializers.md
@rails/validations.md

---

## Customization

### Disable Specific Modules

Comment out any you don't need:

```markdown
@rails/models.md
<!-- @rails/controllers.md -->  <!-- Disabled -->
@rails/routes.md
```

### Enable Only Core

For a minimal setup, enable just the essentials:

```markdown
@rails/models.md
@rails/controllers.md
@rails/routes.md
@rails/style.md
```

### Enable by Feature

Enable based on what you're working on:

**Working on models?**
```markdown
@rails/models.md
@rails/concerns.md
@rails/validations.md
@rails/tests.md
```

**Working on views?**
```markdown
@rails/views.md
@rails/helpers.md
@rails/javascript.md
```

**Working on background jobs?**
```markdown
@rails/jobs.md
@rails/mailers.md
@rails/broadcasting.md
```

## Additional Configuration

You can add project-specific instructions here:

```markdown
## Project-Specific Patterns

@docs/architecture.md
@docs/api_design.md
@docs/deployment.md
```

---

## Notes

- All modules are independent and can be enabled/disabled
- Auto-loads in every new dialog
- Patterns are generic Rails best practices
- Examples are production-ready
- All patterns include testing examples
